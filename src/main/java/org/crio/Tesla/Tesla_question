Problem Description
Tesla is testing their new car which they will be launching soon. The driver of the car started recording the speed of the car. Letâ€™s assume he always starts with a speed of 1500. Whenever his speed changed, he recorded this change in an array. This array is given to you as input. You have to return a result array with two numbers - the highest speed he ever reached and his final speed.
 
Input format
First line contains an integer n.
Second line contains n space separated integers.
 
Output format
Return an array with 2 integers
 
Sample Input 1
5
100 -200 350 100 -600
 
Sample Output 1
1850 1250
 
Explanation
Initial speed is always 1500.
1500+100=1600
1600-200=1400
1400+350=1750
1750+100=1850
1850-600=1250
Among these speeds, his highest speed is 1850 and the final speed is 1250.
 
Constraints
1<=n<=100000
-1000<=diffs[i]<=1000
