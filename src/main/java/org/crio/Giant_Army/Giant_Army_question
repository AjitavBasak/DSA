Problem Description
The planet named GiantX (the citizens of this planet are very very tall, some people can be upto 10^9 cm tall) is on the verge of a war with a different planet. To prepare for this, different army battalions are now recruiting warriors to save the planet. Every battalion has a different minimum height criteria for selecting warriors. There are a total of N people who want to join the army and we are given their heights. There are Q battalions and we are given minimum height requirements for each battalion. For each battalion print how many people are eligible to join.

Input format
First line contains two space separated integers N and Q
Second line contains N space separated integers A[i] representing the heights of N people.
Next Q lines contain one integer (x[j]) each, representing the minimum height required to join the Qth battalion.

Output format
Print Q lines.
The jth line should contain the number of people who are eligible to join the jth battalion.

Sample Input 1
3 1
100 160 130
120

Sample Output 1
2

Explanation 1
There are 3 people with heights 100, 160 and 130. There is only one battalion with the minimum height required to join the battalion being 120. There are two such people (height > 120). Thus, the required answer is 2.

Sample Input 2
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
6
5
4
3
2

Sample Output 2
0
1
2
3
4

Explanation 2
The minimum height required to join the first battalion is 6. Not a single person has a height of at least 6. Thus the answer is 0.
The minimum height required to join the second battalion is 5. Only the fifth person has a height of at least 5. Thus the answer is 1.
The minimum height required to join the third battalion is 4. The fifth and the fourth person has a height of at least 4. Thus the answer is 2.
The minimum height required to join the fourth battalion is 3. Third, fourth and the fifth person has a height of at least 3. Thus the answer is 3.
The minimum height required to join the fifth battalion is 2. Second, third, fourth and the fifth person has a height of at least 5. Thus the answer is 4.

Constraints
1 <= N, Q <= 2*10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
1 <= x[j] <= 10^9
