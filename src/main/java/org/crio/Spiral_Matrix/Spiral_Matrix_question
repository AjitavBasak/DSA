Problem Description
Given a matrix of M x N elements (M rows, N columns), return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.
Input format
First line contains two space separated integers M and N, representing the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively.
Next M lines contain N space separated integers each, which represent the values on each row
Output format
On line containing M*N space separated integers, representing the spiral form of the given matrix.
Constraints
0 <= M,N <= 100
1 <= Matrix[i] <= 100000
